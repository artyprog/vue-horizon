# vuehorizon

> A Vue.js + Horizon JS project

This is an implementation of the <a href="http://horizon.io/docs/getting-started/">Horizon Getting Started tutorial</a> combined with the <a href="https://github.com/vuejs-templates/webpack">Vue Webpack template</a>. I had trouble finding resources on how to combine the two (as they both scaffold their own folders), but I was able to get them to work together with a little bit of research.

## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# start horizon server
hz serve --dev

# serve Vue project with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification (haven't tested yet, should work though...)
npm run build

```

For detailed explanation on how things work, checkout the [guide](http://vuejs-templates.github.io/webpack/) and [docs for vue-loader](http://vuejs.github.io/vue-loader).
